Q1. What class of bug are you reporting?                            [1 point]
	Input non-sanitized --> Arbitrary code execution
___

Q2. Describe the bug:                              [3 points = 0.5 + 0.5 + 2]
a) Where is the bug?
	File, line: command.cpp:134
	Function: lsCommand::exec
___

b) What capabilities does the bug give to the attacker?
	Arbitrary code execution
___

c) What are the conditions under which the bug can be exploited, and describe
your exploit? 
	The user need to be logged in. After that, the user has to:
	1.	create a folder named "rnd;$COMMAND#" (i.e. 'mkdir rnd;$COMMAND#')
	2.	go in this directory (i.e. 'cd rnd;$COMMAND#')
	3.	run the command 'ls'

	This causes command.cpp:134 to run the command
	'ls -l rnd;$COMMAND# >> $TMPDIR 2>&1'
	which leads to
	'ls -l rnd; $COMMAND'
	are allows the user to run whatever he wants to.

___

a) Can the vulnerability be mitigated through automated techniques?    
   If yes, explain.

   TODO
___

b) Describe a code-fix for the bug. This must correspond to the submitted patch.
