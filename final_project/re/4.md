### Description

* Please note that there is no `break;` in every cases of the switch.

* `selector` is a variable represented on 64 bits (labelled (64, ..., 1) (little endian)) such that:
	* **part_1**: Its last 3 bits (from 3 to 1) are used as a selector for the switch part (i.e. `selector & 7`)
	* **part_2**: Its first 61 bits (from 64 to 4) are used to select how many times we go through the for-loop at the end. (i.e. `selector >> 3`)

* We have two arrays (i.e. `array_1` and `array_2`) but 4 pointers on these two (i.e. `array_1`, `array_2`, `second_ptr_array_2`, `second_ptr_array_1`).

`task4` is a function that copies the elements from `array_1` to `array_2` in a special way depending on `selector`.

We start to look at the last three bits of `selector` (see part 2 described above). We copy the first `selector & 7` elements from `array_1` to `array_2`.
Then we copy the next `selector >> 3` groups of 8 elements from `array_1` to `array_2`.

To conclude, `task4` copies the first `selector` elements from `array_1` to `array_2`.

#### Example
Assume we have `array_1`, `array_2` and `selector == 27 == 11011b`. Then `selector & 7` == 3 and `selector >> 3` == 3. This implies that `task4(array_1, array_2, selector)` will copy the first `3+3*8 == 27` elements from `array_1` to `array_2`.
