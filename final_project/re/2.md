# Report 2: task 2

### Code
```c
void ** task2(void **node, char *param_string)

{
  int strs_equal;
  
  if (node != NULL) {
  	char *str_to_compare = (char *)node[2];
    strs_equal = strcmp(param_string, str_to_compare);
    if (strs_equal == 0) { // strings are equal
      node = (void **)node[3];
    }
    else {
      if (strs_equal < 0) { // param_string is "smaller" than str_to_compare
        node = (void **)task2(node[0], param_string);
      }
      else { // param_string is "bigger" than str_to_compare
        node = (void **)task2(node[1], param_string);
      }
    }
  }
  return node;
}
```

### Description

`task2` seems to be a search function. It takes two parameters:
1. `char **node` which is a list of strings of the form:
	* element 0: address of an other node (previous)
	* element 1: address of an other node (next)
	* element 2: a string (value of the node)
	* element 3: address of an other node (result)
2. `char *param_string` which is the string that we are searching for.

We could see this algorithm as a kind of binary search tree for strings. The user would begin with the root node. This function will search for the correct node that has `param_string` stored in its `node[2]`, then returns the elements associated to this string (i.e. `node[3]`).
